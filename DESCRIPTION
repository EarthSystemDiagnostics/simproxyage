Title: Simulate Age Uncertainty in Climate Proxy Records.
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Thomas", "Muench", email = "thomas.muench@awi.de", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This R package implements an stochastic approach to simulate the
age uncertainty in layer-counted climate proxy records by perturbing a reference
chronology by randomly omitting or double-counting the reference layers. The
implementation is an adapted and extended version of the MATLAB code by Comboul
et al. (2014).
