\title{Constrained Brownian Bridge process}
\usage{
BrownianBridge(x, t, acp)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric vector of the perturbed ages from the unconstrained
process; must be of the same length as \code{t}.}

\item{t}{numeric vector with the original (reference) ages.}

\item{acp}{the age control point where the age uncertainty is assumed zero.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of the same length as \code{t} with the perturbed
ages following a Brownian Bridge process.
}
\description{
Transfer an unconstrained age perturbation process into a constrained
perturbation process following the Brownian Bridge concept, assuming an age
control point where the age uncertainty is taken to be zero.
